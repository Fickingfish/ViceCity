                    <p></p>
                    I was born in Liberty City in 1951. My father worked in printing, and as a child I cleaned rollers with him. I planned to follow in my father's footsteps, but, in his own words, "led a different life".
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Sometime before 1971 I joined the Forelli crime family, one of the three main Mafia families in Liberty City and the most powerful at the time. I continued to work for the Forelli family, moving up the ladder and presumably becoming the man they made their own. In 1971, Sonny Forelli, fearing my growing influence, tried to ambush me in the guise of a contract killing at Harwood. However, not only did I survive, but I killed all eleven men sent to kill me. I was arrested and convicted of eleven counts of murder. I was sentenced to death for the murders, but because I kept quiet and did not give up evidence to the Forelli family, Sonny Forelli used court connections to commute my sentence. I remained in prison for fifteen years, refusing to divulge Forelli family secrets to the LCPD. In the press I was nicknamed "The Harwood Butcher.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After I got out of prison in 1986, I continued to deal drugs through Sonny. I met Lance Vance in the course of all kinds of deals, and then he betrayed me and went over to Sonny's side. In the process I killed Lance and Sonny and became the most powerful man in Vice City.

                        One of the newest car in my collection. I won't tell you the make of the car. They don't pay me for advertising. This beautiful baby takes me around all kinds of beautiful places in this brilliant city called Vice City. All the girls in this town want to take her for a ride, but only a select few are allowed to do so.

                        And this is my gangster car. Most of the criminal acts were committed in it. It's a 1967 Chevrolet. 425 horsepower. This baby can do 200 kilometers an hour. I remember the first time I drove it to my buddies' house. Those were the days. Okay, lets take this up to the next level!

                        And this is the pegassi Infernus, a luxury two-door supercar. It has a top speed of 241 kilometers per hour. I first got behind the wheel of this car when Lance Vance drove it to my place to do some criminal work. I like to drive it around with the girls. This picture was taken at the Vice City Beach party. I remember there were a lot of girls there, or was it just me? I think there's cocaine residue on the seat. You want some?
